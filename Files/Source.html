    <p>
        Source is a 3D game engine developed by Valve. It debuted as the successor to GoldSrc in 2004 with the releases
        of Half-Life: Source, Counter-Strike: Source, and Half-Life 2. Valve used Source in many of their games in the
        following years, including Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, and the Portal and Left 4
        Dead franchises. Other notable third-party games using Source include most games in the Titanfall franchise,
        Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines, Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable and Garry’s Mod. Valve released
        incremental updates to Source before it was succeeded by Source 2 in 2015.
