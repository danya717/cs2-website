        macOS
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>macOS</b>, previously <b>OS X</b> and originally <b>Mac OS X</b>, is a <i>Unix-based operating system</i> developed and marketed
        by <i>Apple</i> since 2001. It is the current operating system for Apple's <i>Mac computers</i>. Within the market of <i>desktop</i>
        and <i>laptop</i> computers, it is the <i>second most widely used desktop OS</i>, after <i>Microsoft Windows</i> and ahead of all
        <i>Linux</i> distributions, including <i>ChromeOS</i> and <i>SteamOS</i>. As of 2024, the most recent release of macOS is <i>macOS 15
        Sequoia</i>, the 21st major version of macOS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mac OS X succeeded <i>classic Mac OS</i>, the primary <i>Macintosh operating system</i> from 1984 to 2001. Its underlying
        architecture came from <i>NeXT'</i>s <i>NeXTSTEP</i>, as a result of <i>Apple's acquisition of NeXT</i>, which also brought <i>Steve
        Jobs</i> back to Apple. The first desktop version, <i>Mac OS X 10.0</i>, was released on March 24, 2001. <i>Mac OS X Leopard</i>
        and all later versions of macOS, other than <i>OS X Lion</i>, are <i>UNIX 03</i> certified. The derivatives of macOS
        are Apple's other operating systems: <i>iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, audioOS</i> and <i>visionOS</i>. macOS has supported
        three major processor architectures: originally <i>PowerPC</i>-based Macs in 1999; <i>Intel Core-based Macs</i> from <i>2006</i>;
        and self-designed <i>64-bit Arm Apple M series</i> Macs since <i>2020</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A prominent part of macOS's original <i>brand identity</i> was the use of <i>Roman numeral</i> X, pronounced "ten", as well
        as <i>code naming</i> each release after species of <i>big cats</i>, and later, places within <i>California</i>. Apple shortened
        the name to "OS X" in 2011 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other
        operating systems. After 16 distinct <i>versions</i> of macOS 10, <i>macOS Big Sur</i> was presented as version 11 in
        2020, and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number, similarly to classic Mac OS
        and iOS, but is still named after places within California.
