    <p>
        "Free-to-play" ("F2P" or "FtP") video games are games that give players access to a significant portion of their
        content for free. The term "free-to-play business model" or simply, "free-to-play model", refers collectively to
        business models that ultimately result in the creation of free-to-play games. Games that adhere to free-to-play
        business models are distinct from traditional premium games, which require payment before use. Free-to-play
        games are not to be confused with freeware games, which are entirely costless. Accordingly, free-to-play games
        are sometimes called "free-to-start" due to not being entirely free.[1] Certain free-to-play games have also
        been labeled as "pay-to-win"â€”that is, that players can pay to obtain competitive advantages over other players.
