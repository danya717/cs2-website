        Deathmatch (video games)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Deathmatch, also known as free-for-all, is a gameplay mode integrated into many shooter games, including
        first-person shooter (FPS), and real-time strategy (RTS) video games, where the goal is to kill (or "frag") the
        other players' characters as many times as possible. The deathmatch may end on a frag limit or a time limit,
        and the winner is the player that accumulated the greatest number of frags.

        The deathmatch is an evolution of competitive multiplayer modes found in game genres such as fighting games and
        racing games moving into other genres.
