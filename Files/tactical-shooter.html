        Tactical shooter
    </h2>
    <p>
      A <b>tactical shooter</b> is a <i>sub-genre</i> of <i>first-</i> and <i>third-person shooters</i>, associated with using <i>strategy,
      planning</i>, and <i>tactics</i> in <i>gameplay</i>, as well as the realistic simulations of <i>ballistics, firearm</i> mechanics,
      <i>physics, stamina</i>, and low <i>time to kill</i>. Dating back to <i>strategy games</i> from the late 1980s, the genre first rose
        to prominence in the late 1990s with the releases of several well-received tactical shooters. The popularity of
        the genre saw a decline in the late 2000s as fast-paced "arcade"-like <i>action shooters</i> rose to prominence, it
        has seen a revitalization since the mid-2010s with the successful releases of several modern tactical shooters.
