    <p>
        <b>Counter-Strike (CS)</b> is a series of <i>multiplayer tactical first-person shooter</i> video games, in which opposing
        teams attempt to complete various objectives. The series began on <i>Windows</i> in 1999 with the release of the first
        game, <i>Counter-Strike</i>. It was initially released as a <i>modification</i> ("mod") for <i>Half-Life</i> that was designed by
        <i>Minh "Gooseman" Le</i> and <i>Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe</i> before the rights to the mod's <i>intellectual property</i> were acquired
        by <i>Valve</i>, the <i>developers</i> of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product released in 2000.
