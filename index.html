        It is the fifth entry in the <a href="Files/Counter-strike.html">Counter-Strike</a> series, developed as an
        updated version of the previous entry,
        <a href="Files/Counter-strike Global offensive.html">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> (2012). The game was
        announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on
        September 27, 2023, for <a href="Files/windows.html">Windows</a> and <a href="Files/Linux.html">Linux</a>,
        replacing <i>Global Offensive</i> on <a href="Files/Steam service.html">Steam</a>.

    <p>
        Like its predecessor, the game pits two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, against each other in

        from this setup are also included.
        <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> features major technical improvements over<i> Global Offensive</i>, including a move
        from the <a href="Files/Source.html">Source
        game engine</a> to <a href="Files/Source2.html">Source 2</a>, improved <a href="Files/Graphics.html">graphics</a>,
        and a new "sub-tick" server architecture. In addition, many <a href="Files/maps.html">maps
        from Global Offensive</a> were updated to take advantage of the features of Source 2, with some maps receiving

        Upon release, <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> received generally favorable reviews from critics, with praise for its gunplay
        and overhauled maps. In contrast, player reception was mixed, and the game received thousands of negative user
        reviews on Steam, becoming one of the lowest-rated Valve titles on the platform; criticism was directed at the
        game's performance, the removal of several features that had been present in <i>Global</i> Offensive, and the
        discontinuation of support for the <a href="Files/macOS.html">macOS</a> operating system, which was supported by <i>Global Offensive</i>.

    </h2>
    <img src='images/CS2_Gameplay.png'>
    <p>
        Counter-Strike 2 is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter, in which two teams, the Terrorists and
        Counter-Terrorists, compete to complete various objectives. The game includes two round-based objective
        scenarios: bomb defusal and hostage rescue, with the bomb defusal scenario making up the primary gameplay
        experience. New gameplay features in Counter-Strike 2 include volumetric "smoke physics", a feature where the
        smoke generated by a smoke grenade grows to fill spaces, and can be altered in real time by gunshots or through
        the use of hand grenades. Additionally, the game features a revised weapon loadout system, which only
        allows players to bring five pistols, five "mid-tier" weapons (i.e submachine guns and shotguns), and five
        rifles with them into a match, for a total of fifteen weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
        In standard bomb defusal matches, the Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist teams each have five players. In these
        game modes, eliminated players do not respawn until the next round. Within each round, the goal of the
        Terrorist team is to plant a bomb at one of two bombsites on the map and defend the bombsite until the bomb
        explodes. The Terrorist team can also win the round by eliminating the Counter-Terrorist team. The
        Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them by running out the round clock, killing all Terrorists, or defusing
        the explosive. In a hostage rescue match, the Counter-Terrorist act as the attackers, attempting to rescue
        non-player character "hostages" that the Terrorist team are defending. At the start of each round, players
        are able to purchase different weapons and equipment. A standard match ends when a team wins thirteen rounds.
