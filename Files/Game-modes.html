        Modes
    </h2>
    <p>
        A game mode is a distinct configuration that varies gameplay and affects how other game mechanics behave.
        A game with several modes presents different settings in each, changing how a particular element of the game
        is played.

    <p>
        A common example is the choice between <i>single-player</i> and <i>multiplayer</i> modes in video games, where
        multiplayer can further be <i>cooperative</i> or <i>competitive</i>. A <i>sandbox mode</i> allows free play without
        predefined <i>goals</i>. In a <i>Time Attack Mode</i>, the player tries to score, progress or clear levels in a limited
        amount of time.
