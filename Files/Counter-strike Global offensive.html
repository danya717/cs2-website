    <p>
        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer tactical first-person shooter developed by Valve
        and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two
        years, Global Offensive was released for OS X, PlayStation 3, Windows, and Xbox 360 in August 2012, and for
        Linux in 2014. In December 2018, Valve transitioned the game to a free-to-play model, focusing on revenue from
        cosmetic items.
