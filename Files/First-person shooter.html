        First-person shooter
    </h2>
    <p>
        A <b>first-person</b> shooter (FPS) is a <i>video game</i> centered on gun fighting and other weapon-based combat seen from a
        <i>first-person perspective</i>, with the player experiencing the action directly through the eyes of the <i>main
        character</i>. This genre shares multiple common traits with other <i>shooter games</i>, and in turn falls under the
        action games category. Since the genre's inception, advanced <i>3D</i> and <i>pseudo-3D</i> graphics have proven fundamental
        to allow a reasonable level of immersion in the <i>game world</i>, and this type of game helped pushing technology
        progressively further, challenging hardware developers worldwide to introduce numerous innovations in the field
        of <i>graphics processing units</i>. <i>Multiplayer gaming</i> has been an integral part of the experience, and became even
        more prominent with the diffusion of internet connectivity in recent years.
