    </h2>
    <p>
        Windows is a product line of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Microsoft. It is
        grouped into families and subfamilies that cater to particular sectors of the computing industry â€“ Windows
        (unqualified) for a consumer or corporate workstation, Windows Server for a server and Windows IoT for an
        embedded system. Windows is sold as either a consumer retail product or licensed to third-party hardware
        manufacturers who sell products bundled with Windows.[citation needed]
