    <p>
        Source 2 is a video game engine developed by Valve. The engine was announced in 2015 as the successor to the
        original Source engine, with the first game to use it, Dota 2, being ported from Source that same year. Other
        Valve games such as Artifact, Dota Underlords, Half-Life: Alyx, Counter-Strike 2, and Deadlock have been
        produced with the engine.
