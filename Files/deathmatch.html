        Deathmatch (video games)
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Deathmatch</b>, also known as <b>free-for-all</b>, is a <i>gameplay</i> mode integrated into many <i>shooter games</i>, including
        <i>first-person shooter</i> (FPS), and <i>real-time strategy</i> (RTS) <i>video games</i>, where the goal is to kill (or "<i>frag</i>") the
        other players' characters as many times as possible. The deathmatch may end on a frag limit or a time limit,
        and the winner is the player that accumulated the greatest number of frags.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deathmatch is an evolution of competitive <i>multiplayer</i> modes found in <i>game genres</i> such as <i>fighting games</i> and
        <i>racing games</i> moving into other genres.
