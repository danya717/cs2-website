        Linux
    </h2>
    <p>
        Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)[15] is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux
        kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[17][18][19]
        Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system
        software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system,
        designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.[20]
