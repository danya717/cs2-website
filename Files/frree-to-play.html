        Free-to-play
    </h1>
    <p>
        <b>"Free-to-play" ("F2P" or "FtP")</b> <i>video games</i> are games that give players access to a significant portion of their
        content for free. The term <b>"free-to-play business model"</b> or simply, <b>"free-to-play model"</b>, refers collectively to
        <i>business models</i> that ultimately result in the creation of free-to-play games. Games that adhere to free-to-play
        business models are distinct from traditional premium games, which <i>require payment before use</i>. Free-to-play
        games are not to be confused with <i>freeware</i> games, which are entirely costless. Accordingly, free-to-play games
        are sometimes called <b>"free-to-start"</b> due to not being entirely free. Certain free-to-play games have also
        been labeled as <i>"pay-to-win"</i>â€”that is, that players can pay to obtain competitive advantages over other players.
