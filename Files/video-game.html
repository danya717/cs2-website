    Video game
  </h2>
  <p>
    A <b>video</b> game or <b>computer game</b> is an <i>electronic game</i> that involves interaction with a <i>user interface</i> or <i>input
    device</i> (such as a <i>joystick, controller, keyboard</i>, or <i>motion sensing</i> device) to generate <i>visual feedback</i> from a
    <i>display device</i>, most commonly shown in a <i>video format</i> on a <i>television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display</i> or
    <i>touchscreen</i> on <i>handheld devices</i>, or a <i>virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio
    complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback
    (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam
    inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.
