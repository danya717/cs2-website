        Multiplayer video game
    </h2>
    <p>
        A <b>multiplayer video game</b> is a <i>video game</i> in which more than one person can play in the same game environment
        at the same time, either locally on the same computing system <i>(couch co-op)</i>, on different computing systems
        via a <i>local area network</i>, or via a <i>wide area network</i>, most commonly the <i>Internet</i> (e.g. <i>World of Warcraft, Call
        of Duty, DayZ</i>). Multiplayer games usually require players to share a single game system or use <i>networking
        technology</i> to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants,
        work <i>cooperatively</i> with a human partner to achieve a common goal, or <i>supervise</i> other players' activity. Due
        to multiplayer games allowing players to interact with other individuals, they provide an element of social
        communication absent from single-player games.
