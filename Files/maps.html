        List of competitive Counter-Strike maps
    </h2>
    <p>
        <i>Counter-Strike 2</i>, and its predecessor <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i>, are <i>first-person shooter</i> games
        developed by <i>Valve Corporation</i> in the <i>Counter-Strike series</i>. The franchise has a <i>very large competitive scene</i>,
        which has received large media coverage. As a result, the games' multiplayer <i>maps</i> have longstanding legacies
        within the series, with some becoming significant to the first-person shooter genre as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional gameplay of Counter-Strike features two teams, the Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, fighting for
        control of a map while trying to fulfill their respective objectives. In Counter-Strike esports, the goal of
        the Terrorist team is to either kill all Counter-Terrorists or plant and detonate a bomb at a bomb site within
        the map, and the goal of the Counter-Terrorist team is to prevent the bomb plant, kill all Terrorists,
        or defuse the bomb.

        This article serves as a list of maps featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike 2 that
        have established notability in the first-person shooter genre or in the games' competitive scenes.

        Competitive maps
    </h2>
    <p>
        Different game modes have separate map pools, but Valve designates a group of seven as the "Active Duty" pool.
        Such maps are considered the most balanced and competitive by Valve and were used in nearly all competitive
        Counter-Strike esports tournaments, as well as the Premier <i>matchmaking</i> mode. The group of seven are chosen
        from a wider set of maps, with some community-created maps and some designed by Valve.
    </p>
    <p>
        The list of Active Duty maps changes occasionally, generally by replacing one map at a time. Maps such as
        Dust II have been added, removed, and added back again.
