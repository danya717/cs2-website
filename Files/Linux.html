        Linux
    </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Linux</b> <i>(/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)</i> is a <i>family of open source Unix-like operating systems</i> based on the <i>Linux
        kernel</i>, an <i>operating system kernel</i> first released on September 17, 1991, by <i>Linus Torvalds</i>.
        Linux is typically <i>packaged</i> as a <i>Linux distribution</i> (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting <i>system
        software</i> and <i>libraries—</i>most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system,
        designed as a clone of <i>Unix</i> and released under the <i>copyleft GPL</i> license.
