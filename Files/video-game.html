    Video game
  </h2>
  <p>
    A video game[a] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input
    device (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a
    display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, computer monitor, flat-panel display or
    touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset. Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio
    complement delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback
    (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam
    inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.
