        Tactical shooter
    </h2>
    <p>
        A <b>tactical shooter</b> is a sub-genre of first- and third-person shooters, associated with using strategy,
        planning, and tactics in gameplay, as well as the realistic simulations of ballistics, firearm mechanics,
        physics, stamina, and low time to kill. Dating back to strategy games from the late 1980s, the genre first rose
        to prominence in the late 1990s with the releases of several well-received tactical shooters. The popularity of
        the genre saw a decline in the late 2000s as fast-paced "arcade"-like action shooters rose to prominence, it
        has seen a revitalization since the mid-2010s with the successful releases of several modern tactical shooters.
