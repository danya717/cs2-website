        Volumetric path tracing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Volumetric path tracing is a method for rendering images in <i>computer graphics</i> which was first introduced by
        Lafortune and Willems. This method enhances the rendering of the lighting in a scene by extending the <i>path
        tracing</i> method with the effect of <i>light scattering</i>. It is used for photorealistic effects of participating
        media like fire, explosions, smoke, clouds, fog or soft shadows.
