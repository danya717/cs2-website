        Volumetric path tracing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Volumetric path tracing is a method for rendering images in computer graphics which was first introduced by
        Lafortune and Willems. This method enhances the rendering of the lighting in a scene by extending the path
        tracing method with the effect of light scattering. It is used for photorealistic effects of participating
        media like fire, explosions, smoke, clouds, fog or soft shadows.
