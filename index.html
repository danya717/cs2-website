                It is the fifth entry in the <a href="Files/Counter-strike.html">Counter-Strike</a> series, developed as an
                updated version of the previous entry,
                <a href="Files/Counter-strike Global offensive.html">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a> (2012). The game was
                announced on March 22, 2023, and was released on
                September 27, 2023, for <a href="Files/windows.html">Windows</a> and <a href="Files/Linux.html">Linux</a>,
                replacing <i>Global Offensive</i> on <a href="Files/Steam service.html">Steam</a>.

                Like its predecessor, the game pits two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, against each other in
                various objective-based <a href="Files/Game-modes.html">game modes;</a> additional game modes that stray away
                from this setup are also included.
                <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> features major technical improvements over<i> Global Offensive</i>, including a move
                from the <a href="Files/Source.html">Source
                game engine</a> to <a href="Files/Source2.html">Source 2</a>, improved <a href="Files/Graphics.html">graphics</a>,
                and a new "sub-tick" server architecture. In addition, many <a href="Files/maps.html">maps
                from Global Offensive</a> were updated to take advantage of the features of Source 2, with some maps receiving
                complete overhauls.

                Upon release, <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> received generally favorable reviews from critics, with praise for its gunplay
                and overhauled maps. In contrast, player reception was mixed, and the game received thousands of negative user
                reviews on Steam, becoming one of the lowest-rated Valve titles on the platform; criticism was directed at the
                game's performance, the removal of several features that had been present in <i>Global</i> Offensive, and the
                discontinuation of support for the <a href="Files/macOS.html">macOS</a> operating system, which was supported by <i>Global Offensive</i>.

            <i>Counter-Strike</i> 2 is a <a href="Files/multiplayer.html">multiplayer</a> <a href="Files/Tactical.html">tactical</a>
            <a href="Files/First-person shooter.html">first-person shooter</a>, in which two teams, the Terrorists and
            Counter-Terrorists, compete to complete various objectives. The game includes two round-based objective
            scenarios: bomb defusal and hostage rescue, with the bomb defusal scenario making up the primary gameplay
            experience. New gameplay features in Counter-Strike 2 include <a href="Files/volumetric.html">volumetric</a> "smoke physics", a feature where the
            smoke generated by a smoke grenade grows to fill spaces, and can be altered in real time by gunshots or through
            the use of hand grenades. Additionally, the game features a revised weapon loadout system, which only
            allows players to bring five pistols, five "mid-tier" weapons (i.e submachine guns and shotguns), and five
            rifles with them into a match, for a total of fifteen weapons.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="info5">
        <p>
            In standard bomb defusal matches, the Terrorist and Counter-Terrorist teams each have five players. In these
            game modes, eliminated players do not respawn until the next round. Within each round, the goal of the
            Terrorist team is to plant a bomb at one of two bombsites on the map and defend the bombsite until the bomb
            explodes. The Terrorist team can also win the round by eliminating the Counter-Terrorist team. The
            Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them by running out the round clock, killing all Terrorists, or defusing
            the explosive. In a hostage rescue match, the Counter-Terrorist act as the attackers, attempting to rescue
            non-player character "hostages" that the Terrorist team are defending. At the start of each round, players
            are able to purchase different weapons and equipment. A standard match ends when a team wins thirteen rounds.

            The game features two primary <a href="Files/matchmaking.html">matchmaking</a> modes: Competitive and Premier. Competitive is a continuation
            of Global Offensive's matchmaking system; players can choose any map, and ranks are now determined on a per-map
            basis. Premier plays similarly to Competitive, but instead of allowing the players to queue into any individual
            map, Premier uses a seven-map pool with a voting and banning system. It also follows a revised ranking system,
            whereby—in lieu of Global Offensive's ranking system, which grouped players into eighteen different skill
            ranks—players are given a numerical rating based on their performance.

            Supplementing Counter-Strike 2's primary game modes are four additional modes: Wingman, Casual, <a href="Files/deathmatch.html"> Deathmatch </a> and
            Arms Race. Wingman is a bomb defusal match, but with only two players per team, one bombsite, and matches ending
            after a team wins nine rounds. Casual is another bomb defusal mode, but with no ranking system and an increase
            in the number of players on each team. Deathmatch puts players into a match with no map objective, and
            players trying to achieve the most kills before the match ends. Arms Race plays very differently from other
            modes, featuring no money system or menu to buy weapons. Instead, players are given new weapons after successive
            kills, with the weapons progressively becoming less powerful and more difficult. The first player to get kills
            with all weapons, including a final kill with a knife, wins the game.
