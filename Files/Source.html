        <b>Source</b> is a 3D <i>game engine</i> developed by <i>Valve</i>. It debuted as the successor to <i>GoldSrc</i> in 2004 with the releases
        of <i>Half-Life: Source, Counter-Strike: Source</i>, and <i>Half-Life 2</i>. Valve used Source in many of their games in the
        following years, including <i>Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2</i>, and the <i>Portal</i> and <i>Left 4
